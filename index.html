        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality
          and interactivity to a webpage. Building on a static HTML framework
          and CSS styling, with JavaScript you can store information in
          variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and
          video, add decision-making statements to your code, and do much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the only programming language native to web browsers, JavaScript is
          used all over the web making it a crucial skill in your toolbox. But
          Javascript development skills are also versatile. Once you have
          mastered JavaScript, it is much easier to pick up the fundamentals of
          other programming languages.
