# JavaScript Variables and Data Types

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality and interactivity to a webpage. Building on a static HTML framework and CSS styling, with JavaScript you can store information in variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and video, add decision-making statements to your code, and do much more.

As the only programming language native to web browsers, JavaScript is used all over the web making it a crucial skill in your toolbox. But Javascript development skills are also versatile. Once you have mastered JavaScript, it is much easier to pick up the fundamentals of other programming languages.

## What is Variables?

In JavaScript, variables are just like a bucket where you can store anything you want and use it when needed. Variables are bucket for storing values and use them when needed.

For example:

```

const firstName = 'Archie';

```
In the above example "firstName" is a variable name or a bucket for storing value. In this case our value is "Archie".


## Ways to declare or creating a variable?
In JavaScript there are four ways to declare a variable.

1. Automatically
2. var
3. let
4. const

If the condition meet we should always use const to declare a variable. If not we can use let. We should only use var if the programme has to support older verson of JavaScript code.

## What is Data Types?
The data or values stored in the variables are data and the types of data stored in them are determined the types of data. Take a look the code below:

```
const name = 'Aarav';

```
"Aarav" is a value of name variable. 'Aarav' is a string, we know that because it is in the quotation ''. Thus, this tells us that it is a string data type. Look at another example below:

```
const X = 123;

```
In this example, X is a variable name and has a 123 values. The value in the X variable is number. Hence, its data type is number.
